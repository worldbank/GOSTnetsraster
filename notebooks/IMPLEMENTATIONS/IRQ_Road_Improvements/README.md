# Quantifying effects of road improvements in Tunisia

Tunisia’s economic landscape reflects a dynamic yet uneven development pattern. Coastal cities like Tunis, Sfax, and Sousse serve as key economic hubs, supported by strategic investments, industrial zones, and developed infrastructure. Meanwhile, efforts continue to enhance economic opportunities across all regions, fostering inclusive and balanced growth nationwide. These regions enjoy relatively low poverty rates—Tunis at just 3.5%, Ben Arous at 4.3%, and Ariana at 5.4%—and offer greater employment opportunities, access to markets, and public services. In stark contrast, the interior governorates, particularly in the northwest and center west, remain economically marginalized. Poverty rates in some regions, such as Kairouan (34.9%), Le Kef (34.2%), and Kasserine (32.8%), reflect ongoing challenges related to infrastructure development, investment, and economic integration. Tunisia is working to strengthen regional connections and improve growth opportunities, with the aim of achieving more balanced development across the country.

This analysis focuses on quantifying how road improvements in Tunisia change access to markets and ports, and how the areas around the improved roads have themselves changed. See details on the implementation in the python notebook.
